Project Title: Unit Converter

Description:
This Unit Converter application allows users to easily convert values between various measurement units, including length, weight, and volume. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the app provides an intuitive way to handle conversions efficiently.

Functionalities:

Input Fields: Users can enter a numeric value that they wish to convert.

Unit Selection: A dropdown menu allows users to select the unit they are converting from and the unit they want to convert to, covering a wide range of categories (length, weight, and volume).

Conversion Logic: Once the input value and units are selected, clicking the "Convert" button triggers the conversion process, and the result is displayed in real time.

Dynamic Output: The converted value is shown in a clear format, with the corresponding unit, making it easy for users to read and understand the results.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and managing state.

Tailwind CSS: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.

TypeScript: For type safety and improved developer experience.

This project is part of a 30-day initiative organized by the Governor IT Program, aiming to enhance practical programming skills and application development. The Unit Converter exemplifies fundamental concepts in user interface design, state management, and unit conversion logic, making it an essential addition to my project portfolio.
